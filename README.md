## üéØ Calculation Logic

### Current Salary Calculation
```
Total Current = Basic Pay + Grade Pay + DA + HRA + TA
DA = (Basic Pay + Grade Pay) √ó DA Percentage
HRA = Basic Pay √ó HRA Percentage (rounded to multiples of ‚Çπ9,000)
```

### New Salary Calculation
```
New Basic Pay = (Current Basic + Grade Pay) √ó Fitment Factor
New DA = New Basic Pay √ó New DA Percentage
New HRA = New Basic Pay √ó HRA Percentage (rounded to multiples of ‚Çπ9,000)
New TA = Fixed amount based on new basic pay level
Total New = New Basic + New DA + New HRA + New TA
```

### HRA Calculation (Multiples of ‚Çπ9,000)
```
HRA Amount = Basic Pay √ó HRA Percentage
Rounded HRA = Round(HRA Amount / 9000) √ó 9000
```

### Transport Allowance (Fixed Amounts)
- **‚Çπ3,600**: Basic pay ‚â§ ‚Çπ50,000
- **‚Çπ7,200**: Basic pay ‚Çπ50,001 - ‚Çπ100,000
- **‚Çπ10,800**: Basic pay ‚Çπ100,001 - ‚Çπ150,000
- **‚Çπ14,400**: Basic pay > ‚Çπ150,000

### Increase Calculation
```
Amount Increase = Total New - Total Current
Percentage Increase = (Amount Increase / Total Current) √ó 100
```

## üé® Customization Options

### Visual Customization

You can easily customize the appearance by modifying `styles.css`:

```css
/* Change color scheme */
:root {
    --primary-color: #667eea;

    --success-color: #68d391;
    --error-color: #e53e3e;
}

    box-shadow: 0 15px 35px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Stronger shadow */
}
```

### Calculation Customization

Modify calculation logic in `script.js`:

```javascript
// Adjust HRA calculation
function calculateHRA(basicPay, hraPercentage) {
    // Change from multiples of 9000 to different base
    const hraAmount = basicPay * (hraPercentage / 100);
    return Math.round(hraAmount / 10000) * 10000; // Multiples of 10,000
}

// Adjust TA calculation
function calculateNewTA(newBasicPay, currentTA) {
    // Custom TA calculation based on your requirements
